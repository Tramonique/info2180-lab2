            HTML and CSS are the building blocks of every webpage. HTML provides structure with headings, paragraphs, images, and links, and CSS brings style with colors, typefaces, spacing, and arrangements.
            Together, they transform plain text into readable and interactive pages.
            Knowing how the two languages interact with one another puts you in control of what a site looks like and how it feels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practice is what gets you started with HTML and CSS.
            Begin with coding plain pages utilizing headings, lists, and images and then modify alignment, spacing, and style with CSS. Pay attention to consistency and readability, however, since subtle differences in utilizing a particular size or color of type will have an influence on the user experience.
            You'll discover with experience that HTML gives you structure and CSS gives you the ability to shape it into something unique.

        <h2>Surviving FST</h2>

            Starting at university in the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) may be daunting at first, but it is a fresh and exciting experience.
            The programs challenge students to be critical thinkers, to be problems-solvers, and to be open to situations easily and to build a solid foundation of science and technology.
            With lecture classes, laboratory activities, and assignments on a week-to-week basis, the FST challenges you to develop not only academically but also as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overcoming FST is about establishing a rhythm that suits you. Get a head start by being aware of deadlines, dividing big assignments into smaller ones, and not hesitating to clarify things in tutorials or laboratory classes.
            Master the skill of balancing work and relaxation, as being burnt out is no joke. Above all, develop a rapport with your peers because you will realize almost immediately how collaborative work and group notes can help to slightly ease the most grueling courses.
